Plan is to start work on individual plots that we'll display on the shiny app. Loose ideas for plots are:

Lisa - monthly rainfall (selecting year comparisons)

Rachel - rainfall records (historic vs. current year)

Marta - moving average viz (groundwork for moving averages)

Ingrid - 

James - commuting windows (rain / dry in the hourly weather data)
